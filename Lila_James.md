## About Me

Greetings,

I am Lila Josey James, a dedicated and innovative software engineer. Specializing in Python, LangChain, OpenAI, Sci-kit, Pandas, NoSQL & SQL, Matplotlib and more. I have a strong commitment to developing creative and engaging technology solutions. My career transition from teaching to tech has equipped me with unique problem-solving skills and a passion for continuous learning and co-creation, making me an ideal candidate for your team.

In my recent roles, I have focused on Human-Computer Interactions and information pipelines, which have allowed me to develop a deep understanding of cutting-edge technologies such as LLMs, Neural Networks, Network Science, and Information Theory (Binary and Quantum). I have successfully contributed & deployed bespoke applications across several Massive Online Courses in Georgia Tech's Design and Intelligence Lab, which has partnered with IBM Watson. These experiences have honed my ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver impactful solutions while keeping the upstart time to a minimum

I am particularly drawn to environments that are dynamic, challenging, and offer continuous learning opportunities. My background in education has instilled in me a strong foundation in curriculum development and engagement, which I now leverage to create innovative technological solutions. My technical skills, combined with my ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and effectively, make me a valuable asset to any team.

I am excited about the possibility of contributing to your organization and bringing my unique perspective and expertise to your projects. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm can align with your needs.

Sincerely,  
Lila Josey James
